## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
<<<<<<< HEAD
PIB <- read.csv('dat/PIB/variacion_anual_del_pib_d.csv',sep = ";",header = T,encoding = 'UTF-8')
FMI <- PIB[-c(37:39),] 
plot(FMI)
=======
plot(pressure)
>>>>>>> ed316769aaf56f744316b907822bfbd64c8b595e
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
